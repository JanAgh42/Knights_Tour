The task is to traverse the chessboard with legal moves of the chess horse so that each square of the chessboard is traversed (visited) exactly once. The solution must be designed in such a way that it is possible to solve the problem for square chessboards of different sizes (at least from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20) and that the journey along the chessboard can be started on any starting square.

The Warnnsdorf heuristic in combination with backtracking was used to solve this puzzle.
